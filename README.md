<h1 align="center">Live chat clone</h1>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p> Fifth project developed for Driven Software Engineer bootcamp, you can check it out by this <a href="https://gabao55.github.io/live-chat-uol-clone/">link</a>. The first module of the course was an introduction to Interfaces and Front-end Aplications, so we explored interactions and API requests through JavaScript, so to consolidate knowledge the project task was to create a live chat clone webpage.
